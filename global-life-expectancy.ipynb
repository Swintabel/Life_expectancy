The most common type of this measure is 'Life Expectancy at birth', the average number of years that a newborn could expect to live if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area. [[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2) Generally, past studies suggest that developed countries tend to have a higher life expectancy compared to less developed countries.[[3]](#ref3) However, with the introduction of some immunization policies and evolving socio-economic factors over the years, it is important to find empirical evidence to answer questions on the country specific determining factors of life expectancy.\n    \n    \n\n### OBJECTIVE\nLiving longer has been one of humanity’s greatest ambitions, and currently living more than 80 years is a realistic expectation in many countries. [[5]](#ref5) Several factors can lead to death, but good health policies are expected to be associated with higher life expectancy in any population. Health policies are perhaps not the only or most relevant driver of life expectancy but other factors such as; socio-economic status, lifestyle, unforseen disease outbreaks, amongst others may also influence a population's life expectancy on various levels.[[4]](#ref4) In 2019, life expectancy at birth reached 73.3 years globally but with a difference of around 16 years between high-income and low-income countries.[[6]](#ref6) Given the aforementioned background, this project seeks to investigate the following Questions;\n\n* To what level does a country's economic status affect life expectancy of its population?\n* Does lifestyle trends in a country affects life expectancy?\n* Do Health policies have a strong impact on life expectancy?\n* Does the prevalence of diseases have a strong effect on life expectancy?","metadata":{"hide_input":true,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**\n","metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"hide_input":false,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# loading libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sn\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom scipy.stats.mstats import winsorize\nimport os\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","metadata":{"hidden":true,"hide_input":false,"tags":[],"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **ABOUT DATA**\n\nThe Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.
